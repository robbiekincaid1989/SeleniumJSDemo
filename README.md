# SeleniumJSDemo
Demo and proof of concept scripts for Selenium Web Driver in JavaScript on Node.JS (written and ran on Windows 10).

To run, you must have Node.JS and the Selenium Webdriver setup according to the Selenium documentation (<a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/selenium_installation/installing_selenium_libraries/">See here</a>).

<h3>DDF Test</h3>
Basically, this script was a proof of concept - Search specific tags on the Digital Dream Forge website and log their values to the console. I took it a step further by writing their values to a file, which I thought may be easier to include, or copy and paste into a report.
